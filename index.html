                    I am currently working to strengthen my skills as a web developer. This industry allows for both
                    immense creativity, and life-long learning. As I continue to hone my skills, I can see that this
                    industry requires creativity not only in the actual design, but in the implementation of a website.
                    By continually working with others, we are able to design truely novel approaches in the
                    information age.

                    At this time, I am working as a Medical Laboratory Scientist at the University of Colorado Hospital
                    Anschutz Medical Campus. This work is extremely interesting and rewarding. My current work involves
                    transfusion medicine, and the transfusion of blood products and their derivatives.

                    I also have my Airframe and Powerplant license with an FCC endorsement. I worked as a civilian
                    aircraft electrician in both regional and general aviation.
